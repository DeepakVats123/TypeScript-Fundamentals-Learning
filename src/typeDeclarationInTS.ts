// Type Declaration in TypeScript

// Its all about understanding, when we use some third party Libraries, we install these.
// But sometimes in a rare case we need to install types manually because, we don't get internal support of TS.
// because we don't get suggestions and error in that case, so for that, we setup that manually,

// npm install some-library-name
// npm install -D @types/some-library-name

// this is how we install types manually.
